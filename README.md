# Roman Numeral Converter

This is my attempt on one of the five projects for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification offered by FreeCodeCamp.

## Features

- Convert Arabic numerals (1-3999) to Roman numerals
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Input validation and error handling

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
2. `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the conversion logic and user interactions.
3. `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.

## Limitations

- The converter only works for numbers between 1 and 3999.
- Decimal numbers are not supported (only integers).
